Express Color Scheme For Sublime Text 2
========================================

This is a syntax highlighting color scheme for Sublime Text 2. 
Built using soft pastel colors helping ease eye strain during prolonged programming.

I spend quite a lot of time with this to make it feel very light on the eyes.

Installation
------------

Clone/copy the repo folder (unzipped) into your Packages/ folder. In Linux it is under ~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages/Express Color Scheme/

Then, in Sublime Text 2, goto:

  Preferences > Color Scheme > Express Color Scheme

to activate the Express color scheme.
